## MCP Server

The standard NAP installer bundles the native `nap-mcp-server` binary with `nap`. If the MCP command is missing or broken, rerun the standard NAP installer from a host shell. 

The MCP server is not a daemon; agent clients start it on demand over stdio, and it proxies tool calls to the host `nap` CLI.

## Agent Sandbox Integration

When running inside a sandboxed environment (e.g., Codex) without outbound network access, use MCP tools instead of shelling out to the `nap` CLI directly. The MCP server runs on the host machine, starts only when the agent/MCP client launches it over stdio, and proxies tool calls to the host `nap` CLI.

Direct `nap` CLI examples in this skill are for humans, host-local shells, and non-sandboxed scripts. In an agent sandbox, use the MCP tools for any operation that may need Lore/cloud/network access.

## Available MCP Tools

All nap CLI commands are available as MCP tools with `nap_` prefix. For example:
- `nap resolve` -> `nap_resolve` tool
- `nap create` -> `nap_create` tool
- `nap set` -> `nap_set` tool

Prefer MCP tools over shell commands when in a sandbox.
